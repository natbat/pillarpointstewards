## Local development environment

You'll need Python 3 and PostgreSQL - I recommend using [Postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com/).

Create a local database called `pillarpointstewards`.

Open `Postgres.app`, double click on the `postgres` database, then type the following at the prompt:

    create database pillarpointstewards;

It should look like this:
```
postgres=# create database pillarpointstewards;
CREATE DATABASE
```

In the local checkout of the repo, create a new Python virtual environmet like this:

    python3 -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment:

    source venv/bin/activate

Install (or upgrade) the dependencies from `requirements.txt`:

    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

Start the development server, which will also run any database migrations:

    ./runserver.sh

### Running the tests

    pytest pillarpointstewards

### Running management commands

The `./manage.sh` script sets the correct environment variables for development and runs management commands, for example:

    ./manage.sh shell_plus
    ./manage.py makemigrations

### Creating a superuser for the Django admin

    ./manage.sh createsuperuser

Follow the prompts. You can leave email blank.

# Fragments

Some site content - such as emergency contact phone numbers - is held in the database to avoid sharing it in a public GitHub repository.

The `contact_details` fragment shows contact details and is displayed on the logged-in homepage.

Content for these needs to be copiend and pasted into new databases - we keep those in the private repository [pillarpointstewards-private](https://github.com/natbat/pillarpointstewards-private).

They can be edited at `/admin/homepage/fragment/`.
