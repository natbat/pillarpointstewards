            <p>It's remarkable to consider that if all the tidepools in California were combined, 
            they would span a mere 15 square miles. This vital ecosystem serves as an exclusive 
            haven for numerous unique species and serves as a crucial nursery for the broader ocean.</p>

              <strong>sharing our enthusiasm</strong> and employing proven interpretative methods.

              <p>We encourage them to discover practical ways to contribute to the preservation of 
                our reefs and oceans, <strong>combating plastic pollution and addressing climate

Stewards in this program go out in pairs and talk to visitors about the life and ecosystem of the reef as well as teaching sustainable harvesting practices and collection rules. The reef has a flat area with shallow pools and grasses as well as deeper canyons with taller outcrops.

              <p>Pillar Point Reef is near but not in the Montara MPA and SMCA, it teems with diverse 
                marine life. Our stewards educate visitors on sustainable practices. The reef features 
                shallow pools, seagrass areas, and deep canyons.</p>
