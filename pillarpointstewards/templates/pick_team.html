            <!-- <p>Pillar Point reef is a large rocky outcrop that juts into the ocean breeding a rich and biodiverse habitat which is just south of theÂ protected Montara MPA and SMCA so is governed by Fish & wildlife rules and is heavily harvested. Stewards in this program go out in pairs and talk to visitors about the life and ecosystem of the reef as well as teaching sustainable harvesting practices and collection rules. The reef has a flat area with shallow pools and grasses as well as deeper canyons with taller outcrops.

            <p>Pillar Point Reef is near but not in the Montara MPA and SMCA, it teems with diverse 
              marine life. Our stewards educate visitors on sustainable practices. The reef features 
              shallow pools, seagrass areas, and deep canyons.</p>
